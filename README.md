# Sentiment Analysis of Movies Reviews

I use and compare various different methods for sentiment analysis on movies reviews (binary classification problem).

## Dataset Information

The train and test dataset contains a text column with the review and a label column with a unique integer, 1 if the review is positive and 0 if the review is negative.

## Requirements

* `Numpy`
* `Pandas`
* `Scikit-learn`
* `Wordcloud`
* `Matplotlib`
* `Spacy`

or 

```linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
